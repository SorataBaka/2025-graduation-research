  abstract  = {We present IndoBERTweet, the first large-scale pretrained model for Indonesian Twitter that is trained by extending a monolingually-trained Indonesian BERT model with additive domain-specific vocabulary. We focus in particular on efficient model adaptation under vocabulary mismatch, and benchmark different ways of initializing the BERT embedding layer for new word types. We find that initializing with the average BERT subword embedding makes pretraining five times faster, and is more effective than proposed methods for vocabulary adaptation in terms of extrinsic evaluation over seven Twitter-based datasets.}

  abstract  = {Although Indonesian is known to be the fourth most frequently used language over the internet, the research progress on this language in natural language processing (NLP) is slow-moving due to a lack of available resources. In response, we introduce the first-ever vast resource for training, evaluation, and benchmarking on Indonesian natural language understanding (IndoNLU) tasks. IndoNLU includes twelve tasks, ranging from single sentence classification to pair-sentences sequence labeling with different levels of complexity. The datasets for the tasks lie in different domains and styles to ensure task diversity. We also provide a set of Indonesian pre-trained models (IndoBERT) trained from a large and clean Indonesian dataset (Indo4B) collected from publicly available sources such as social media texts, blogs, news, and websites. We release baseline models for all twelve tasks, as well as the framework for benchmark evaluation, thus enabling everyone to benchmark their system performances.}

  abstract  = {Twitter is an excellent source of data for NLP researches as it offers tremendous amount of textual data. However, processing tweet to extract meaningful information is very challenging, at least for two reasons: (i) using nonstandard words as well as informal writing manner, and (ii) code-mixing issues, which is combining multiple languages in single tweet conversation. Most of the previous works have addressed both issues in isolated different task. In this study, we work on normalization task in code-mixed Twitter data, more specifically in Indonesian-English language. We propose a pipeline that consists of four modules, i.e tokenization, language identification, lexical normalization, and translation. Another contribution is to provide a gold standard of Indonesian-English code-mixed data for each module.}
